#Renamer

This is a small file renamer that is designed to rename files following a pre set pattern. 

It works by taking in inn a file name, adding a number at the end (starting at 1), and finally adding a file extension. Default dir is ../Files, but you can choose a different path. 

File Name: Family_Vaccation

File Extension: .png

Files: 
Family_Vaccation01.png
Family_Vaccation02.png
Family_Vaccation03.png
Family_Vaccation04.png
        .
        .
        .

Simply run the script and be greeted by a gui interface and start renaming!
